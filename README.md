# Sorting-Visualizer

We have learnt many sorting algorithms. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization.

So decided to Create a web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript to visualize how various sorting algorithms work and how elements are swapped in the array to get to the sorted array in the end.
